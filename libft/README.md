What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at Wethinkcode that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

LIBFT fuction Example

atoi	
ft_putnbr		
isalpha	
ft_putchar_fd		
isdigit	
ft_putstr_fd		
isalnum	
ft_putendl_fd		
isascii	
ft_putnbr_fd		
isprint			
toupper			
tolower


TO USE

git clone https://github.com/sicebi/_libft.git
cd libft     
make all    (to make libriary libft.a)

make clean (to clear .o (object)files)
make fclean (to clean libriary and objectes files)
make re     (to fclean and to make all)
